Installation
=============

.. _installation:

The preferred way to install and use cideMOD is from Docker. Docker images of the cideMOD package are available in the DEFACTO project website.
In the future, images will probably be available in DockerHub.

Optionally one can install cideMOD in a FEniCS working environment by downloading the repository and installing it with the python package manager.
