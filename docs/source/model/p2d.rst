Dimensional model
==================

We use the well-known P2D model described by :cite:t:`Doyle1993`. As each domain is normalized with its thickness, the gradients that we use are:

.. math::

    \begin{gathered}
                \hat{\nabla} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{L_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \\ \frac{1}{H_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \\ \frac{1}{W_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \end{pmatrix}
    \end{gathered}

Where :math:`L_i`, :math:`H_i` and :math:`W_i` are the domain thickness, height and width. However, for a P2D model, only the first row of the vector is used.

* Mass transport in the electrolyte
    The mass transport in the electrolyte is calculated in :func:`c_e_equation <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.c_e_equation>` function.
    
    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \epsilon \frac{\partial c_e}{\partial t} =
            \hat{\nabla} \left( D_{eff} \hat{\nabla} c_e \right) + \frac{1}{F}\sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i}
        \end{gathered}

* Charge transport in the electrolyte
    The charge transport in the electrolyte is calculated in :func:`phi_e_equation <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.phi_e_equation>` function.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \hat{\nabla} \left( \kappa_{eff} \hat{\nabla} \varphi_e \right) = \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i}
        \end{gathered}

* Charge transport in the electrode
    The charge transport in the solid electron conductor materials is calculated in :func:`phi_s_equation <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.phi_s_equation>` function.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \hat{\nabla} \left( \sigma_{eff} \hat{\nabla} \varphi_s \right) = \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i}
        \end{gathered}

    In the current colectors, a similar equation is used, but in this case, there is no exchage with the electrolyte, therefore the right hand side term equals zero.

* Mass transport in the active material (pseudodimension)
    The mass transport in the active material is calculated in the :class:`c_s_equation <cideMOD.models.particle_models.implicit_coupling.SpectralLegendreModel>` class using Legendre polynomials.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \frac{\partial c_s}{\partial t} =
            \hat{\nabla} \left( D_s^{eff} \hat{\nabla} c_s \right)  ;
            \qquad
            - D_s^{eff} \hat{\nabla} c_s \Bigg|_{r=R_p} = \frac{j_{i}}{F}
        \end{gathered}

* Exchange between the electrolyte and the electrode by lithium intercalation
    The intercalation exchange current between the electrolyte and the active materials is calculated in :func:`j_int <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.j_Li_equation>` function.

        \end{gathered}

            \eta = \varphi_s - \varphi_e - U_{eq}(c_s^{surf})
        \end{gathered}

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =
            \hat{\nabla} \left( \lambda_{eff} \hat{\nabla} T \right) + q    ;
            \qquad
            - \lambda_{eff} \hat{\nabla} T \Bigg|_{\Gamma}= h (T-T_ext)
        \end{gathered}

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            q = q_{ohm}+q_{rev}+q_{irr}
        \end{gathered}
    
    * Ohmic heat source
        This corresponds to the heat generated by the transport of charge within the cell. It is calculated in :func:`solid_ohmic_heat_equation <cideMOD.models.thermal.equations.solid_ohmic_heat_equation>` function:

        .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                q_{ohm} =  \sigma_{eff} \hat{\nabla} \varphi_s \hat{\nabla} \varphi_e + \kappa_{eff} \hat{\nabla} \varphi_e \hat{\nabla} \varphi_e - 2 \frac{RT}{F} \kappa_{eff} (1-t_0^+) (1+ln()) \frac{\hat{\nabla} c_e}{c_e} \hat{\nabla} \varphi_e
            \end{gathered}

    * Reversible reaction heat source

                q_{rev} =  \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i} T \frac{\partial U_i(c_s)}{\partial T}
            \end{gathered}

        This represents the irreversible heating due to the polarization heat generated by the exchange current at the electrolyte-electrode interface. It is calculated in :func:`reaction_irreversible_heat <cideMOD.models.thermal.equations.reaction_irreversible_heat>` function

        .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                q_{rev} =  \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i} \eta
            \end{gathered}
